# How to Run the Frontend
In the `src` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# How to Run the Backend

Split the terminal, and go to the `backend` directory.

Run this command:

### `python -m venv --system-site-packages venv`

This will create an environment with all the necessary dependencies for the application.

Next, run this command:

### `./venv/bin/activate`

This command will activate the virtual environment.

Lastly, run the backend application with this command:

### `python app.py`
